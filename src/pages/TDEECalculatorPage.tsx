                  Our <strong>TDEE Calculator</strong> (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) helps you determine the total number of calories your body burns in a day. Understanding your TDEE is essential for effective weight management, nutritional planning, athletic performance, and overall health optimization.

                <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6">How The TDEE Calculator Works</h3>
                <p>
                  The calculator uses the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to first estimate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)â€”the number of calories your body needs at complete rest. It then factors in your activity level using activity multipliers to determine your Total Daily Energy Expenditure, providing a comprehensive view of your caloric needs for maintenance, weight loss, or weight gain.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-2">
                  The formula takes into account your age, biological sex, height, weight, and activity level, as these factors significantly impact your metabolism and energy expenditure. The result is a personalized estimate of how many calories you burn daily.

                <p>
                  Your Total Daily Energy Expenditure consists of several components:
                </p>
                
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
                  <li>
                    <strong>Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):</strong> The calories your body needs to maintain basic physiological functions at rest (60-70% of TDEE).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Thermic Effect of Food (TEF):</strong> The energy used to digest, absorb, and process nutrients (approximately 10% of TDEE).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (EAT):</strong> Calories burned during intentional physical exercise (varies widely based on activity level).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT):</strong> Energy expended for everything that is not sleeping, eating, or sports-like exercise (fidgeting, walking, standing, etc.).
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6">How to Use Your TDEE Results</h3>
                <p>
                  Once you have your TDEE value, you can use it to establish calorie targets based on your goals:
                </p>
                
                <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-2">
                  <li>
                    <strong>For Weight Maintenance:</strong> Consume calories equal to your TDEE.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>For Weight Loss (Cutting):</strong> Create a moderate calorie deficit by consuming 10-20% fewer calories than your TDEE. A deficit of 500 calories per day typically results in about 1 pound of weight loss per week.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <strong>For Weight Gain (Bulking):</strong> Create a calorie surplus by consuming 10-20% more calories than your TDEE to support muscle growth when combined with appropriate resistance training.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                
                <p className="mt-2">
                  Remember that these are estimates. The best approach is to start with these recommendations, track your results for 2-3 weeks, and then adjust as needed based on your body's actual response.

                      TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) is the total number of calories your body burns in a 24-hour period. It includes your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) plus additional calories burned through physical activity, digestion, and non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT).

                      Biological sex is an important factor in calculating BMR because males and females typically have different body compositions, with males generally having more muscle mass and less body fat than females at the same weight. Since muscle tissue burns more calories at rest than fat tissue, this affects the base metabolic rate calculation. The Mifflin-St Jeor equation includes different constants for males and females to account for these average physiological differences.

                      You should recalculate your TDEE whenever there are significant changes to the input factors: if your weight changes by more than 10 pounds (4.5 kg), if your activity level changes substantially, or approximately every 3-6 months as your metabolism naturally changes with age. Regular recalculation helps ensure your calorie targets remain appropriate. Additionally, if you're not seeing expected results with your current calorie intake, it may be worth recalculating and reassessing your activity level selection.
