      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">How Accurate Are the Results?</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Our calculator uses validated statistical models from peer-reviewed research to predict adult height based on birth measurements, particularly the Sorensen method. Like all prediction methods, it provides an estimate with a confidence interval rather than an exact guarantee.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Research shows that birth measurements correlate with adult height with reasonable accuracyâ€”typically within 6-7 cm (about 2.5 inches) for 95% of individuals. The calculator provides this prediction interval so you can understand the range of likely outcomes.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Limitations to Consider</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        When using any height prediction method, keep these limitations in mind:
      </p>
      <div className="mt-3 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <p>No prediction method is 100% accurate due to the complex nature of growth</p>
        <p>Environmental factors during childhood and adolescence can influence final height</p>
        <p>Medical conditions affecting growth may not be accounted for in general prediction models</p>
        <p>Predictions work best for populations similar to those in the original research studies</p>
      </div>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For the most comprehensive height assessment, especially if there are concerns about growth, consult with a pediatrician or pediatric endocrinologist who can evaluate multiple factors and track growth over time.
