      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-10 mb-4" id="increase-height">Can You Really Increase Your Height?</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        With height being such a valued physical characteristic in many societies, it's no surprise that countless products and techniques claim to increase height. But what actually works?
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Height Myths Debunked</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Let's address some common height enhancement claims:
      </p>
      <div className="mt-3 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <p><strong>Stretching exercises:</strong> While stretching may temporarily improve posture, it doesn't actually increase skeletal height</p>
        <p><strong>"Grow taller" supplements:</strong> Most have no scientific evidence supporting their claims and may contain unregulated ingredients</p>
        <p><strong>Hanging exercises:</strong> These may decompress the spine temporarily but don't create permanent height gains</p>
        <p><strong>Special diets:</strong> While good nutrition is important for growth, no specific food will make you taller beyond your genetic potential</p>
      </div>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Medical Interventions</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In specific medical situations, certain interventions may influence height:
      </p>
      <div className="mt-3 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <p><strong>Growth hormone therapy:</strong> Only effective for children with diagnosed growth hormone deficiency or certain specific medical conditions</p>
        <p><strong>Limb lengthening surgery:</strong> A major surgical procedure with significant risks, typically only performed for severe height discrepancies or dwarfism conditions</p>
      </div>
      <p className="mb-4">
        These medical interventions are not appropriate for children of normal height and should only be considered under the guidance of specialized physicians for medically necessary reasons.
      </p>

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3">Optimizing Natural Growth Potential</h3>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Instead of seeking ways to exceed genetic height potential, focus on these evidence-based approaches to help reach your natural maximum height during growth years:
      </p>
      <div className="mt-3 mb-4 space-y-2">
        <p>Maintain balanced nutrition with adequate protein, calcium, and vitamin D</p>
        <p>Ensure consistent, quality sleep of 8-10 hours daily during childhood and adolescence</p>
        <p>Stay physically active with age-appropriate exercise</p>
        <p>Avoid smoking, alcohol, and drug use, which can negatively impact growth</p>
        <p>Manage any chronic medical conditions with proper treatment</p>
      </div>
      <p className="mb-4">
        For adults whose growth plates have closed, height increase is not possible without major medical intervention. However, improving posture through core-strengthening exercises and posture training can help maximize your existing height by 1-2 cm.
