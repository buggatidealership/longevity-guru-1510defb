      <p>
        Understanding how tall your child might become serves several practical purposes beyond mere curiosity:
      </p>
      
      <p className="mt-3 mb-4">
        <strong>Sports and activities planning:</strong> Some sports favor certain body types and heights. Early indications of adult height can help guide children toward activities where they may have natural advantages.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Nutritional planning:</strong> Children going through growth spurts have different nutritional needs. Anticipating these periods can help parents optimize nutrition.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Setting realistic expectations:</strong> Understanding the genetic foundations of height helps both parents and children set realistic expectations about physical development.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        <strong>Health monitoring:</strong> Tracking a child's growth against predictions provides an additional data point for overall health monitoring. Significant deviations from expected growth patterns can sometimes indicate underlying health concerns.
