      <p className="text-left">
        You can't stop birthdays from coming, and you can't magically turn back the biological clock – but you can take steps to improve your odds of conceiving at 35+. Think of it as optimizing the factors that are within your control.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-left">
        While no lifestyle change can completely counteract age-related egg loss, a healthy body and habits can create the best possible environment for those eggs and improve overall fertility. Here are some evidence-backed ways to increase your chances of conception:

          Nutrient-rich foods, regular exercise, and other positive lifestyle habits can support fertility and improve your chances of conceiving after 35.

      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3 text-left">Maintain a Healthy Weight</h3>
      <p className="text-left">
        Weight plays a significant role in fertility. Women who are underweight or overweight can have disrupted hormone levels and ovulation. Aim for a body mass index (BMI) in the normal range, or whatever weight your doctor deems healthy for you.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3 text-left">Eat a Fertility-Friendly Diet</h3>
      <p className="text-left">
        There's no special "fertility diet" that guarantees pregnancy, but certain eating patterns are linked to better fertility. Emphasize whole, nutrient-dense foods: plenty of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats (like avocados, nuts, and olive oil).
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        Foods rich in antioxidants (found in berries, leafy greens, etc.) may help protect eggs and reproductive organs from oxidative stress. Ensure you get sufficient protein (including some plant protein from beans and lentils) and iron.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        Some research suggests a Mediterranean-style diet can improve fertility, possibly by reducing inflammation. Also, include full-fat dairy in moderation if you enjoy dairy – one large study (the Nurses' Health Study) found that women who ate full-fat dairy had lower rates of ovulatory infertility than those consuming mostly low-fat dairy.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        And don't forget to start a prenatal vitamin or folic acid supplement if you're trying to conceive – folic acid supports early fetal development and may improve ovulatory function as well.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3 text-left">Stay Hydrated and Limit Harmful Substances</h3>
      <p className="text-left">
        It's easy to overlook hydration, but good blood flow (important for the uterus and ovaries) relies on being well-hydrated. Aim for about 8 glasses of water a day. At the same time, limit alcohol and caffeine, and avoid tobacco and drugs.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        Moderate caffeine (one small cup of coffee a day) is generally fine, but high caffeine intake has been linked to fertility issues, so keep it to under 200 mg a day. Alcohol should be minimized when trying to conceive (and avoided once you're actively trying in the two-week wait, since early pregnancy might be affected).
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        Most critically, do not smoke – smoking accelerates egg loss and is strongly associated with earlier menopause and diminished ovarian reserve. In fact, smoking is perhaps the most significant lifestyle factor in fertility decline, as it can damage DNA in eggs. If you do smoke, seek help to quit as a top priority for your fertility and overall health.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3 text-left">Exercise Regularly (but Don't Overdo It)</h3>
      <p className="text-left">
        Regular physical activity helps maintain healthy weight, reduces stress, and improves insulin sensitivity – all good for fertility. Aim for a balanced exercise routine with moderate activities like brisk walking, jogging, cycling, or yoga most days of the week. Strength training a couple of times a week is also beneficial.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        However, avoid excessive or intense exercise that leads to very low body fat or loss of your menstrual period. Elite female athletes, for example, sometimes stop ovulating due to the physical stress. So, think "moderate" and "consistent" rather than extreme. If you're not sure, discuss with a doctor what an appropriate exercise plan looks like for you while trying to conceive.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3 text-left">Consider Supplements (With Medical Advice)</h3>
      <p className="text-left">
        A number of supplements are touted for fertility, but two that come up frequently for women over 35 are Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) and DHEA. CoQ10 is an antioxidant that cells use for energy production. Our natural CoQ10 levels decline with age.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        Some fertility specialists recommend CoQ10 (usually 200–600 mg daily) for older women or those with low ovarian reserve, aiming to improve mitochondrial function in eggs. Early studies have shown that CoQ10 might improve egg quality and even pregnancy rates in women with diminished ovarian reserve. It's not a magic pill, but given its low risk, many doctors feel it's worth trying in preparation for pregnancy or IVF.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        DHEA, a mild androgen hormone, is another supplement sometimes used (typically 25 mg three times a day for a few months) for women with diminished ovarian reserve. Some studies and clinical experiences suggest DHEA may increase the pool of follicles and improve the odds of success in IVF for such women. However, DHEA is a hormone precursor and not appropriate for everyone – it should only be taken if recommended and monitored by a fertility specialist.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        Other supplements that may be beneficial include vitamin D (if you're deficient), vitamin B12 (if you're vegetarian/vegan or have low levels), and omega-3 fatty acids (for general health). Always consult with a healthcare provider before starting supplements, to ensure they're necessary and won't interfere with other medications.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3 text-left">Reduce Stress and Prioritize Mental Health</h3>
      <p className="text-left">
        The relationship between stress and fertility is complex – stress alone does not typically cause infertility, but chronic stress can throw off your hormonal balance and menstrual cycles in some cases. More importantly, trying to conceive, especially with the pressure of the biological clock, can itself be very stressful and emotionally draining.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        Finding ways to manage stress will improve your quality of life and may indirectly help your fertility by keeping you consistent with healthy habits and intercourse. Consider mind-body practices like yoga, meditation, or acupuncture, which some women find helpful during the trying-to-conceive journey.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        Even simple things like daily walks in nature, journaling, or joining a support group for women trying to conceive can relieve anxiety. If you're facing fertility challenges, don't hesitate to seek support from a therapist or counselor – mental health is a vital part of the equation. Remember, be kind to yourself during this process.
      </p>
      
      <h3 className="text-xl font-medium mt-6 mb-3 text-left">Track Ovulation and Time Intercourse</h3>
      <p className="text-left">
        When fertility is reduced, making the most of your fertile window each cycle becomes even more important. Use ovulation tracking methods to identify your prime days. You can chart your basal body temperature (BBT) and cervical mucus, or use over-the-counter ovulation predictor kits (OPKs) that detect the LH surge before ovulation. There are also fertility tracking devices and apps that can help.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        Typically, the fertile window is the 5 days leading up to and including ovulation, with the highest chance on the day of ovulation and the day prior. Plan to have intercourse at least every other day (or every day if possible) during this window. If you're unsure when you ovulate – for instance, if your cycles are irregular – an OPK or a consultation with your doctor can help pin it down.
      </p>
      <p className="text-left">
        Maximizing frequency around ovulation ensures that sperm are present when the egg is released. And contrary to some myths, there's no need to "save up" sperm – regular intercourse is fine and likely beneficial. For couples with normal fertility, the odds of conception in a given month are around 20-25% at best; for women 35+ it might be somewhat lower per month, so hitting that fertile window consistently is key to stacking the odds in your favor.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mt-6">
        Finally, one thing to keep in perspective: you can do everything "right" and still not conceive immediately. That's not a personal failure – it's just how probability works. Fertility is part luck, part biology. These lifestyle measures tilt the odds in your favor and ensure you're in the best health possible for pregnancy (which is also important), but they can't guarantee success.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        So, implement the changes you can, but don't blame yourself for factors beyond your control. Give yourself grace and remember that needing medical help (like fertility treatments) is absolutely okay and common, especially as women wait longer to have children. The next section will discuss when and how to seek help from a fertility specialist.
