      <p className="text-left">
        When discussing fertility in your 30s and 40s, you'll often hear about "egg quality." But what exactly does that mean? Egg quality refers to an egg's potential to lead to a healthy pregnancy. High-quality eggs have the correct number of chromosomes and enough energy (from mitochondria) to develop into a viable embryo.
      </p>
      
      <p className="text-left">
        Poor-quality eggs may have chromosomal abnormalities or low energy reserves, making them less likely to fertilize, implant, or grow into a healthy baby. Age is the biggest factor affecting egg quality. As eggs sit in the ovaries over the decades, their DNA can accumulate damage.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        By the time a woman reaches her late 30s, a higher proportion of her eggs have incorrect chromosome counts. This is why women of advanced maternal age have more embryos with abnormalities and higher miscarriage rates. Essentially, egg quality declines as age increases, even if you're perfectly healthy otherwise.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        It's estimated that by age 40, the majority of a woman's eggs are chromosomally abnormal, compared to a much smaller fraction in her early 20s. The steep drop in fertility after 35 is largely due to this decline in egg quality.
      </p>

        Egg quality is often confused with egg quantity, but they are different (though related) concepts. Egg quantity (your ovarian reserve) is how many eggs you have left – we'll cover that in the next section. Egg quality is about how good those remaining eggs are. A woman in her late 30s might still have a decent number of eggs left, but if many of them are of poor quality, it can be difficult to get pregnant or stay pregnant.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        This is why some women in their 40s opt for IVF with preimplantation genetic testing (PGT) – a process that screens embryos for chromosomal normalcy to select the healthiest ones. Unfortunately, there is no simple test for egg quality in real time.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Doctors infer egg quality based on a woman's age and fertility history (for example, recurring miscarriages can hint at egg quality issues). However, modern advances like AMH tests and antral follicle counts (explained below) help gauge overall ovarian reserve, which correlates with the pool of available eggs.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Remember that quality matters more than quantity for achieving a healthy pregnancy. Even a younger woman with relatively few eggs can often conceive because a good portion of her eggs are high quality. Conversely, an older woman might have some eggs left but struggle if most of them are chromosomally abnormal.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        The bottom line: egg quality naturally decreases with age, especially after 35, leading to increased infertility and miscarriage risks. This is a central piece of the fertility-after-35 puzzle. The good news is that if even one healthy egg is ovulated and fertilized, pregnancy is possible – which is why many women over 35 do succeed. The challenge (and sometimes the heartbreak) is that it may take longer or require medical help to find that good egg.
