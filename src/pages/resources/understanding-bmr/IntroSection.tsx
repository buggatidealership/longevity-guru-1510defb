      <p className="mb-4">
        Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) is one of the most fundamental concepts in understanding how our bodies use energy. Despite its importance, BMR remains a mystery to many people trying to manage their weight, improve their fitness, or optimize their nutrition.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-4">
        At its core, <strong>Basal Metabolic Rate</strong> represents the minimum amount of energy (calories) your body requires to perform essential life-sustaining functions while at complete rest. These functions include breathing, circulating blood, regulating body temperature, growing and repairing cells, and maintaining organ function—processes that continue 24 hours a day, even when you're sleeping.
      </p>
      
      <p className="mb-6">
        Think of BMR as your body's "idle mode" energy consumption—the baseline number of calories you would burn if you spent the entire day resting in bed. Remarkably, this baseline energy expenditure accounts for approximately 60-75% of the total calories most people burn daily.

          <strong>Key Point:</strong> Your BMR is the largest component of your daily energy expenditure, which is why understanding it is crucial for effective weight management and nutritional planning.

        In this comprehensive guide, we'll explore what BMR is in detail, the factors that influence it, how to calculate it accurately, and how you can apply this knowledge to achieve your health and fitness goals. Whether you're looking to lose weight, gain muscle, or simply maintain optimal health, understanding your BMR is an essential first step.
