        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-medium mb-1">Emily, 32</h4>
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>Profile:</strong> 5'4", 125 lbs, small frame, A cup starting size</p>
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>Goal:</strong> Natural-looking B/C cup for her petite frame</p>
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>Choice:</strong> 275cc moderate-profile silicone implants, placed under the muscle</p>
          <p className="text-sm"><strong>Outcome:</strong> "I went with slightly smaller implants than I initially wanted after trying sizers during my consultation. I'm so glad I didâ€”they look completely natural on my frame but still give me the boost I wanted. I can still run comfortably and don't have to buy specialty bras."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-medium mb-1">Rachel, 28</h4>
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>Profile:</strong> 5'9", 155 lbs, athletic build, B cup starting size</p>
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>Goal:</strong> Proportional increase while maintaining her active lifestyle</p>
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>Choice:</strong> 375cc high-profile silicone implants, placed using the dual-plane technique</p>
          <p className="text-sm"><strong>Outcome:</strong> "With my broader shoulders and taller height, I needed something substantial to create the proportion I wanted. The high-profile implants give me projection without excessive width, and they look completely natural in athletic wear."</p>
        </div>
        
        <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg">
          <h4 className="font-medium mb-1">Nicole, 35</h4>
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>Profile:</strong> 5'6", 140 lbs, medium frame, post-pregnancy AA cup</p>
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>Goal:</strong> Restore volume lost after breastfeeding two children</p>
          <p className="text-sm mb-2"><strong>Choice:</strong> 325cc moderate-plus profile silicone implants with a small lift</p>
          <p className="text-sm"><strong>Outcome:</strong> "I just wanted to look like 'me' again after my body changed so much from pregnancy. The combination of the lift and moderately-sized implants restored my pre-pregnancy C cup, but with better shape. I can wear my old clothes again, and the results look and feel natural."</p>
