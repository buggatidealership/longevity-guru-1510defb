    {
      question: "How much can I save if I make $2,000 a month?",
      answer: "On a $2,000 monthly income, aim to save 10-15% ($200-300) for retirement. Start with $50-100 monthly in a Roth IRA, increasing gradually. Maximize employer matches if available, and claim the Saver's Credit on taxes. Even saving $100 monthly from age 25 could grow to approximately $190,000 by age 65 (assuming 7% average returns)."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I retire without a 401(k)?",
      answer: "Yes, you can retire without a 401(k) using alternatives like IRAs, Roth IRAs, and taxable investment accounts. Many self-employed individuals and those without employer plans successfully retire using these options. An IRA allows annual contributions up to $6,500 (2023) with similar tax advantages to a 401(k), while Roth IRAs offer tax-free growth and withdrawals in retirement."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the best retirement plan for low-income earners?",
      answer: "The Roth IRA is typically the best retirement plan for low-income earners because contributions are made after-tax (when your tax rate is low) and qualified withdrawals in retirement are completely tax-free. Additionally, low-income earners may qualify for the Saver's Credit, providing a tax credit of up to 50% on the first $2,000 contributed to a retirement account."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I boost retirement savings with minimal disposable income?",
      answer: "To boost retirement savings with minimal disposable income: 1) Claim the Saver's Credit for a tax credit up to 50% of contributions, 2) Save tax refunds automatically into an IRA, 3) Use micro-saving apps to round up purchases and invest the difference, 4) Generate side income through gig work dedicating those earnings to retirement, and 5) Gradually increase savings by 1% of income annually so you barely notice the difference."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Social Security enough to retire on if I can't save much?",
      answer: "Social Security alone is generally insufficient for a comfortable retirement. The average monthly benefit is about $1,700 (2023), which is below the poverty line in many areas. While Social Security provides a foundation, even modest additional savings can significantly improve your retirement lifestyle. Focus on building supplemental income through any means possible, even if contributions seem small initially."
