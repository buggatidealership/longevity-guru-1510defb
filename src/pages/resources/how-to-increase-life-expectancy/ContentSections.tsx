      </div>
      
      <p>
        The nutrition protocol isn't merely a "diet"—it's a precisely calibrated nutrient delivery system. It involves consuming 70+ measured ingredients daily, beginning with the morning Super Veggie Green Giant (36+ vegetables, nuts, and berries with exact macronutrient ratios). This approach delivers specific compounds like sulforaphane, EGCG, and anthocyanins that directly impact longevity pathways.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cornerstone: standardization. The protocol requires identical meals at identical times, eliminating variability and optimizing metabolic measurements. It includes zero added sugar, measured caloric intake (calibrated to exact RMR via metabolic cart testing), plant-centered nutrition (100+ g of fiber daily), and time-restricted feeding (16:8). Blood markers show that practitioners can achieve a metabolic age up to 17.5 years younger than their chronological age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data point: Daily nutrient intake in the protocol exceeds the 95th percentile of the population, providing cellular machinery with optimal substrates for longevity-promoting processes like autophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis, and DNA repair mechanisms.
      </p>
