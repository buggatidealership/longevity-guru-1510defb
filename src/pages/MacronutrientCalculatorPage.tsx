      question: "What is a macronutrient calculator?",
      answer: "A macronutrient calculator is a tool that helps you determine the optimal amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and fats you should consume daily based on your personal details, activity level, and fitness goals."
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate is this macronutrient calculator?",
      answer: "This calculator uses the scientifically validated Mifflin-St Jeor equation to estimate your daily energy needs, then applies appropriate macronutrient ratios based on your goal. While it provides a good starting point, individual results may vary based on factors like genetics, metabolism, and precise activity levels."
    },
    {
      question: "How much protein do I need to build muscle?",
      answer: "For muscle building, this calculator recommends approximately 25% of your calories from protein. For most people, this translates to about 1.6-2.2g of protein per kg of body weight daily, which research shows is optimal for muscle protein synthesis and recovery."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I adjust my macros if I'm not seeing results?",
      answer: "Yes. The calculator provides a starting point, but you may need to adjust based on your body's response. If you're not losing fat despite following the recommendations, you might need to reduce carbs slightly. If you're not gaining muscle, you might need to increase overall calories, particularly from protein and carbs."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I recalculate my macros?",
      answer: "It's advisable to recalculate your macros every 4-6 weeks, or whenever your weight changes by more than 5-10 pounds, your activity level changes significantly, or your fitness goals shift. This ensures your nutrition plan stays aligned with your current needs."

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" id="how-it-works">How This Calculator Works</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our macronutrient calculator uses the scientifically validated Mifflin-St Jeor equation to first calculate your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which is then adjusted based on your activity level to determine your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE).
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Depending on your goal (lose fat, maintain, or build muscle), we apply a calorie modifier to your TDEE and then distribute those calories across the three macronutrients (protein, carbohydrates, and fat) in optimal ratios for your specific goal.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              These ratios are based on research showing that higher protein intake is beneficial during fat loss to preserve muscle mass, while higher carbohydrate intake supports muscle growth during a building phase.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section className="mb-8">
            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" id="why-track-macros">Why Track Macronutrients?</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Counting calories alone doesn't account for the quality of those calories. Two diets with identical calorie counts but different macronutrient compositions can produce dramatically different results in terms of body composition, energy levels, and overall health.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Protein is essential for muscle repair and growth, and has the highest thermic effect of food (TEF), meaning your body burns more calories digesting it. Carbohydrates fuel high-intensity exercise and replenish muscle glycogen. Fats are crucial for hormone production and cell health.
            </p>
            <p className="mb-4">
              By optimizing your macronutrient intake based on your goals, you can maximize fat loss while preserving muscle, or optimize muscle growth while minimizing fat gain.

            <p className="mb-4">
              Once you have your macronutrient targets, you'll need to track your food intake to ensure you're hitting these targets. Here are some practical tips:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li>Use a food tracking app like MyFitnessPal or Cronometer to log your meals</li>
              <li>Plan your meals in advance to ensure they fit your macro targets</li>
              <li>Focus on whole, nutrient-dense foods rather than processed alternatives</li>
              <li>Consider meal prepping to save time and ensure consistent macro intake</li>
              <li>Don't stress about hitting your targets perfectly every day - aim for 90% compliance</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Remember that these calculations provide a starting point. Monitor your progress over 3-4 weeks and adjust as needed based on your results. If you're not seeing changes in your body composition or performance, you may need to adjust your calorie intake or macronutrient ratios.
