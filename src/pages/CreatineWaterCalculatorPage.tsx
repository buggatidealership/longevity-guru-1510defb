      question: "How much water should I drink with creatine?",
      answer: "The general recommendation is to drink about 3-4 liters of water daily when taking creatine. However, your specific needs depend on your body weight, activity level, climate, and whether you're in the loading or maintenance phase of creatine supplementation."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to drink more water during creatine loading phase?",
      answer: "Yes, you should increase your water intake during the creatine loading phase (typically 20g/day for 5-7 days). Since creatine draws water into your muscles, you need additional water to prevent dehydration and support the increased cellular hydration."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get dehydrated while taking creatine?",
      answer: "Yes, creatine can increase your risk of dehydration if you don't increase your water intake accordingly. Creatine causes muscles to draw in more water, which means less water is available for other bodily functions if you don't compensate by drinking more."
    },
    {
      question: "How can I tell if I'm drinking enough water with creatine?",
      answer: "Signs of adequate hydration include clear or light yellow urine, absence of thirst, and normal energy levels. If your urine is dark yellow, you feel thirsty, or experience headaches, you may need to increase your water intake."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I drink more water when exercising on creatine?",
      answer: "Absolutely. Exercise increases fluid loss through sweat, and creatine supplementation can amplify your hydration needs. For intense workouts, you may need an additional 0.5-1 liter of water before, during, and after exercise."

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" id="how-it-works">How This Calculator Works</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Our Creatine Water Intake Calculator estimates your optimal daily water intake when taking creatine supplements by considering:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Body Weight</strong>: Heavier individuals typically need more water, with a base calculation of 30-40ml per kg of body weight.</li>
              <li><strong>Activity Level</strong>: Your general physical activity affects your baseline hydration needs.</li>
              <li><strong>Training Intensity</strong>: More intense workouts increase fluid loss through sweat and metabolic processes.</li>
              <li><strong>Creatine Protocol</strong>: Loading phase (20g/day) requires more water than maintenance phase (5g/day).</li>
              <li><strong>Climate</strong>: Warmer environments increase fluid loss through sweating and require greater water intake.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              The calculator provides your total recommended daily water intake, along with a breakdown showing your base hydration needs and the additional water recommended specifically to support creatine supplementation.

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4" id="creatine-water">Why Proper Hydration is Essential with Creatine</h2>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Creatine works by increasing water content in muscle cells, which is why proper hydration is crucial when taking this supplement:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li><strong>Cellular Hydration</strong>: Creatine draws water into muscle cells, which can reduce water available for other bodily functions if total intake is inadequate.</li>
              <li><strong>Performance Benefits</strong>: Proper hydration helps maximize creatine's performance-enhancing effects.</li>
              <li><strong>Kidney Function</strong>: Adequate water intake helps reduce the load on kidneys when processing creatine.</li>
              <li><strong>Reduced Side Effects</strong>: Proper hydration can help minimize common side effects like cramping, bloating, and digestive discomfort.</li>
              <li><strong>Optimize Absorption</strong>: Taking creatine with sufficient water helps ensure proper absorption and utilization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mb-4">
              Most experts recommend increasing water intake by at least 500ml for every 5g of creatine consumed, with even higher recommendations during the loading phase.
